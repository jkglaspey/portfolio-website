Hush UCF is a social media app that utilizes the *MERN stack* to create a **full-stack** web application. The primary goal of this website is to act as a safe platform to post confessions about anything related to the University of Central Florida. This project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform), and acted as an introduction to React and React Native.
