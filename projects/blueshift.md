## Alien AI Description.

- The alien utilizes a state machine as its governing behavior.
- It uses optimized raycasting, as well as audio vicinity to track the player.
- It is equipped with memory - a system implemented to help the alien find the player near recently-spotted locations.
- The player can escape from the alien only if its sightline is broken long enough, or the player hides outside its observation area.
