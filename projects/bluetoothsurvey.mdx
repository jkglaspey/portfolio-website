# Abstract:

This survey presents a comprehensive study of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) security threats, with a focus on both protocol-level vulnerabilities and implementation flaws across IoT and medical devices. It categorizes attacks including passive sniffing, man-in-the-middle (MITM), DoS, pairing-based attacks, and BLE spoofing. Each threat is supported by academic literature from 14 research papers.

We provide detailed technical explanations, real-world implications, and mitigation strategies for each class of attack. The report concludes with a discussion on persistent limitations in BLE security and future recommendations for protocol improvement and device-side safeguards.

# Methodology:

Fourteen peer-reviewed papers were selected based on relevance, recency, and breadth of coverage. Each attack type is presented with:

- A technical breakdown of how the attack works
- Known devices and use cases impacted
- Proposed mitigation strategies (when available)

# Discussion:

Findings highlight the need for:

- Standardized user authentication steps during pairing
- Firmware-level encryption enforcement for stored credentials
- More restrictive BLE stack designs at the OS level, especially for Android
- Improved BLE protocol design to isolate paired device trust zones
