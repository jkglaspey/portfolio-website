I cofounded Team Scripted, a small freelance team with a goal to create quality projects within the Minecraft community. Over time, we have had several minigames submitted to Mojang's official [Realms](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms) collection, as well as established a community of several hundred members.

### Minecraft provides the community with a custom scripting language, and works as an internal game engine. Due to years of being exposed to this, I have assimilated myself into the game development workflow.
