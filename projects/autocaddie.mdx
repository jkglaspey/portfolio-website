description: "AutoCaddie is an innovative project designed to revolutionize golf training through the use of artificial intelligence and sensor technology. Developed using a combination of deep neural networks and hardware sensors, AutoCaddie provides real-time, personalized feedback on a golfer's swing. The system analyzes video data of the user's swing and integrates it with sensor data to deliver comprehensive insights, allowing golfers to improve their form and technique. By capturing metrics such as shoulder rotation, hip movement, and arm straightness, AutoCaddie identifies key areas for improvement and presents this information through a user-friendly graphical interface. The system's modular design allows for future enhancements, making it a versatile tool adaptable to various levels of golfing experience. AutoCaddie aims to lower the barrier to advanced golf training, offering a powerful, data-driven coaching experience to golfers at all skill levels."

# Project Goals.  

* Develop an artificial intelligence program utilizing machine learning to provide multiple modes of feedback for a user’s golf swing (using primarily a driver).
* Design a printed circuit board (PCB) capable of performing wireless transmission of simple numeric data to a central computer.
* Interface kinematic and video data into a central data processor computer.
* Measurably improve the user’s golf swing through the usage of the system.
