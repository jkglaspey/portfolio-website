# Project Goals.  

* Develop an artificial intelligence program utilizing machine learning to provide multiple modes of feedback for a user’s golf swing (using primarily a driver).
* Design a printed circuit board (PCB) capable of performing wireless transmission of simple numeric data to a central computer.
* Interface kinematic and video data into a central data processor computer.
* Measurably improve the user’s golf swing through the usage of the system.
